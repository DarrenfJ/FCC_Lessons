Adding bootstrap

FCC info:

from: https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-responsive-design-with-bootstrap-fluid-containers

This time, we'll style it using the popular Bootstrap responsive CSS framework.

Bootstrap will figure out how wide your screen is and respond by resizing your HTML elements - hence the name Responsive Design.

With responsive design, there is no need to design a mobile version of your website. It will look good on devices with screens of any width.

You can add Bootstrap to any app by adding the following code to the top of your HTML:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"/>

In this case, we've already added it for you to this page behind the scenes.

How to add add:

you can do so via a link: see https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/ or any one of a number of CDN's
 "A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver webpages and other Web content to a user based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and a content delivery server." from: http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CDN.html
you can also just download the CSS and use it as a file references in 'locally' in your HTML doc.. you should take a quick boo at this: http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/

if you are playing around in CodePen they have a settings page where you can quickly add all kinds of libraries and frameworks and they add them for you when you choose them via a drop in the setting page...

here's another CDN that seems to have tons of stuff... https://www.maxcdn.com/

and finally on CDN's (not that there isn't a wealth of knowledge about it on the interweb).. google hosts a bunch of javascript libraries as well: https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/
